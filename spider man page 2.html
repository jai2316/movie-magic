<p>Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in the Marvel Comics. He is one of the most well-known superheroes in the Marvel Universe. The character was created by the writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in August 1962. He was an orphan being raised by his Aunt May 
and Uncle Ben as an ordinary teenager. He would deal with the normal struggles of being young as well as the struggles of being a costumed crime fighter. His powers were superhuman strength, speed, agility, the ability to cling to almost every surface and the ability to shoot spider-webs using a device that he invented, which he calls "web-shooters." He reacts to danger quickly with his "spider-sense," enabling him to combat many foes.

Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, 
when teenagers in superhero comic books were usually only sidekick to the protagonist. The series featured Peter Parker, a high school student who frequently suffered rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness. Most young readers could easily relate to this.[8]: 210  Unlike some teen heroes, such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man never had any adult mentors like Captain America and Iron Man to teach him to be a superhero. He had to learn for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility" – a quote that he would cherish from his late Uncle Ben.
